    /*
     * A data structure is like a tool that helps a computer organize and manage 
     * information effectively. It not only stores data but also helps in doing things 
     * like sorting, finding, and saving data. Different types of data structures are 
     * used in almost every computer program to make it work smoothly.
     * 
     * There two primary types of data structures: 
     * Linear Data Structures 
     * Non-Linear Data Strcuctures 
     * 
     * Linear Data Structures 
     * It refers to a type of data arrangement where elements are organized sequentially, 
     * each linked to its preceding and succeeding elements. Examples of linear data structures 
     * include arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists. 
     * 
     * Static data structures have a fixed memory size, making it straightforward to access elements. 
     * Arrays are a common example of a static data structure.
     * 
     * Dynamic data structures, on the other hand, don't have a fixed size and can be adjusted during 
     * runtime. This flexibility can be advantageous for optimizing memory usage. Examples of dynamic 
     * data structures include queues and stacks.
     * 
     * Non-linear data structures are characterized by elements not being placed in a sequential or 
     * linear order. Traversing all elements in a single run is not possible in non-linear structures. 
     * Trees and graphs are examples of non-linear data structures.
